This is a repository for anyone and everyone who is trying to use data to better understand the situation on the New Zealand border to source and share sources, data, and code - please feel free to make a pull request, or suggest any sources I should add. 

**Sources in this repo:**
**nzmiq_spot_availability_data_Raghu_Pushpakath.xlsx**
This is an analysis from Raghu P Pushpakath of MIQ slot availability data from Jun 30 to Aug, according to the @allmiqdates Twitter feed. Raghu used the Twitter API to get the data for the 3352 slots that became available in MIQ during this period. The spreadsheet has several sheets in it - the fourth sheet is the most interesting. It shows how much lead time there is between the date the slot became available, and the slot itself (i.e. how long a person has to book a flight and get home if they score the slot). 344 slots (about 10% of the total) had 5 days or less of lead time. Raghu shared this analysis on Facebook in the MIQ: NZ Managed Isolation and Quarantine group and offered this data publicly. 

**Cameron Conradie's analysis - daily MIQ occupancy**
I'm going to link to the google sheet instead of uploading this because I think it still updates every day. Get it here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aFuO4gDn9RUe32NAP_NJYquXtlx3BpYyhCC7ZVjFY2w/edit?fbclid=IwAR38lmB-NonZInX8fnuahJtdVV66-9ZFAk5XfqE8DbT3w35kim7Xj7_V-Q0#gid=0 nad Cameron's notes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B7z5FKFmEFNc0ff7nKe73agItiGOv7ByVj0XtDki8Wk/edit

**Kea report**
This is a report based on a survey from the Kea foundation (https://www.keanewzealand.com/), I've already asked if we can have the data and the answer is no, but there are some useful figures in there.

**Nau Mai Welcome Home Report**
This is from the Helen Clark foundation, it uses the Future Aspirations survey data amongst other sources to ex[plore the NZ diaspora and discuss the implications of our coming home.

**Migration data explorer from MBIE** 
https://mbienz.shinyapps.io/migration_data_explorer/
I haven't looked up close at this yet, but it has variables such as V1 Visitor visa decisions (no surprises there, but in case you want a chart....). Someone might want to look at the V1 Application Substream variable, the only category that sees an increase post lockdown is 'other' -- I'm guessing these are the special exemptions that have been issued for the Wiggles and so on. Also there is monthly arrivals data here which differentiates by residency status as well as citizenship.
