This is a repository for anyone and everyone who is trying to use data to better understand the situation on the New Zealand border to source and share sources, data, and code.

**Sources in this repo:**
**nzmiq_spot_availability_data_Raghu_Pushpakath.xlsx**
This is an analysis from Raghu P Pushpakath of MIQ slot availability data from Jun 30 to Aug, according to the @allmiqdates Twitter feed. Raghu used the Twitter API to get the data for the 3352 slots that became available in MIQ during this period. The spreadsheet has several sheets in it - the fourth sheet is the most interesting. It shows how much lead time there is between the date the slot became available, and the slot itself (i.e. how long a person has to book a flight and get home if they score the slot). 344 slots (about 10% of the total) had 5 days or less of lead time. Raghu shared this analysis on Facebook in the MIQ: NZ Managed Isolation and Quarantine group and offered this data publicly. I will also request his code and add it to this repo if he's ok with sharing it.
